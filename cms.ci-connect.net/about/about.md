## CMS Connect 

Starting in 2013, The University of Chicago provided a single sign-on service for the [US CMS Collaboration](https://uscms.org/uscms_at_work/collaboration/organization.shtml), with direct institutional and working group access
to the US CMS Global Pool. In 2025, it was superceded by a new iteration of the service hosted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Sign up instructions can be found [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookCMSConnect#Sign_up_to_CMS_Connect)
