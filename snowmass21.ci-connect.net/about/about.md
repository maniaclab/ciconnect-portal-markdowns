## Snowmass21

Snowmass Connect was a job submission service to the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/) in support of the [Monte Carlo Task Force](https://snowmass21.org/montecarlo/energy) working group of the [Energy Frontier group](https://snowmass21.org/energy/start).  The Snowmass 2021 process was organized by the [Division of Particles and Fields](https://www.aps.org/units/dpf/) of the American Physical Society. Snowmass is an opportunity for the entire HEP community to come together to identify and document a vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. and its international partners.
